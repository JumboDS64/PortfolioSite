	"description": "My fan-made designs for two of the unseen weapons from Fractal Block World. Drawn in Krita.\nI wanted each to fit with the aesthetics of the enemies that drop ammo for them. Laser ammo is dropped by Goons, a scarred zombie-like enemy, so I based it on a medical syringe gun. Minigun ammo is dropped by Spiders, so I made it look like it was some kind of organic insectoid weapon (not that spiders are insects, but you understand what I mean...)"
